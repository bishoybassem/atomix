# Atomix

A standalone Java version of the [KAtomic](https://games.kde.org/game.php?game=katomic) puzzle game ([another link](http://kp-atomix.googlecode.com/hg/index.html)). The game's objective is to reassemble a molecule from the given atoms by sliding them around.

### Features

* Used Java 2D API to render all of the game's graphics, thus scalling won't cause any quality loss.
* Added several kinds of sliding animations and effects.
* Movements are tracked, along with undo and redo options.
